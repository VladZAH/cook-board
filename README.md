# cook-board
CookBoard is a React app that helps people to cook with ingredients available and hopefully help with global food waste problem. 
You can search dishes to make by ingredient or by the name.
 web stack:
 - NodeJS + axios
 - JavaScript ES5 & ES6
 - ReactJS (hooks)
 - HTML + CSS
 I am planning to improve it by adding mongoDB server.
